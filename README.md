# Youtube Search Keyword Analysis

## Project Overview


	This  project aims to analyze the correlation between video popularity and the most relevant/liked comments
  This project utilizes two datasets: "Video_stat.csv" and "Comment_stat.csv." The "Video_stat.csv" dataset contains essential details about each video, including its title, likes, views, keyword, and comment count. 
  On the other hand, the "Comment_stat.csv" dataset provides relevant comments for each video listed in "Video_stat.csv," along with information about the sentiments and likes associated with those comments.

This project revolves around six SQL queries that extract and calculate various metrics from the datasets to gain insights into video popularity and user engagement. 

Each query focuses on a specific aspect of the analysis and provides valuable information for content creators and marketers to optimize their video content and engagement strategies
